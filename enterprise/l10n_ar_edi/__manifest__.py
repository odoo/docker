Functional
----------

Be able to create journals in Odoo to create electronic customer invoices and report then to AFIP (via webservices).
The options available are:

    * Electronic Invoice - Web Service
    * Export Voucher - Web Service
    * Electronic Fiscal Bond - Web Service

In the electronic journals if you validate an invoice this one will be validated in both Odoo and AFIP. This validation is
made at the instant and we recieve and "approved/approved with observation/rejected" state from AFIP. If the invoice has
been rejected by AFIP will not be post in the system and a pop up message will be shown with both the error detail (reject reasons)
we recieve and a HINT about what the problem could be.

For auditing and troubleshooting purposes we also add a menu "Consulit Invoice in AFIP" that let us to consult invoices previously
sent to AFIP and last number used as support for any possible issues on the sequences synchronization between Odoo and AFIP.

    NOTE: From the Journal's form view we are able to force a sync between the odoo sequences to each of the document types in
    with the last numbers registered in AFIP.

From vendor bills, we have added a functionality that can be configured in the accounting settings to be able to verify
vendor bills in AFIP to check if the vendor bills are real (more information please review the setting description).
