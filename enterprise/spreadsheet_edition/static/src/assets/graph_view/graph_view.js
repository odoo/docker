/**
 * This patch is a little trick, which require a little explanation:
 *
 * In this patch, we add some dependencies to the graph view (menu service,
 * router service, ...).
 * To test it, we add these dependencies in our tests, but these dependencies
 * are not added in the tests of the base graph view (in web/). The same thing
 * occurs for the button "Insert in spreadsheet".
 * As we do not want to modify tests in web/ in order to integrate a behavior
 * defined in another module, we disable this patch in a file that is only
 * loaded in test assets (disable_patch.js), and re-active it in our tests.
