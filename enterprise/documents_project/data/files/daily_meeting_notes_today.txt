Meeting Summary:

- The team spent the morning discussing the best brand of coffee to stock in the office kitchen. After much deliberation, they decided on a brand that was neither too strong nor too weak.
- Mitchell Admin mentioned having had a very important conversation with the client, but couldn't remember any of the details.
- Mitchell Admin asked some questions, and the project manager answered them. The questions were so profound and enlightening that they were met with a moment of silence as everyone contemplated their existence.
- Marc Demo is doing a good job with the tasks assigned to him. He has been diligently counting the number of paper clips in the office and has reported that there are exactly 723.

The meeting ended, and everyone left the room, feeling equally fulfilled and confused. The next meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, at 9:00 PM.
